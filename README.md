# EX 10 Implementation of SVM For Spam Mail Detection
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a program to implement the SVM For Spam Mail Detection.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware ‚Äì PCs
2. Anaconda ‚Äì Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm

Here's a simple four-sentence algorithm for implementing K-Means Clustering for customer segmentation:
1. Initialize by selecting ùëò
2. k cluster centroids randomly from the dataset.
3. Assign each customer to the nearest centroid based on a distance measure (e.g., Euclidean distance).
4. Update each centroid to the mean position of all customers assigned to it.
5. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until centroids no longer change significantly, then use the resulting clusters to segment the customers.

## Program:
```

X_train,X_test,y_train,y_test=train_test_split(X,y,test_size=0.2,random_state=42)

model=svm.SVC(kernel='linear')
model.fit(X_train,y_train)

predictions=model.predict(X_test)
print("Accuracy:",accuracy_score(y_test,predictions))
print("Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test,predictions))

def predict_message(message):
    message_vec = vectorizer.transform([message])
    prediction = model.predict(message_vec)
    return prediction[0]

new_message="Free prixze money winner"
result=predict_message(new_message)
print(f"The message: '{new_message}' is classified as: {result}")
```
